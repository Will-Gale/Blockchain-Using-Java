# Blockchain-Using-Java

Created my own Blockchain in java using hashing and array lists to create blocks of data with unique digital signatures that chain each block together. The Blockchain objects are then displayed in JSON format.

# Dependencies - Import GSON

You will need to import GSON which is a library created by google that allows you to convert a Java object to a JSON formatted string.

# Blockchain Features:

- Made up of individual blocks that store data
- Has an individual digital signature that links the blocks together

(Features to add: Mining to validate new blocks, validating data, transactions, signatures, wallets)
